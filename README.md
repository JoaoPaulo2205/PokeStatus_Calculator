I started learning a new lib in Java, and decided to make a small project to learn and document.
For day one I made a frame about the size of the phone and created a button, using JButton.

pretty basic, there are a lot more ideas to implement, but i'll take a slow pace
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For day two, I made a lot of changes, Text Fields to insert the attribute level, and a Gengar image in the top. Also, I created the function to calculate the IV correctly.
I used JLabel for image and text in JFrame, ImageIcon to set up the image in JLabel, JTextField to create the text field, ActionEvent to know and execute the commands when the button is pressed.

Haven't made validations yet, like, the IV cant be higher than 100 or less than 0.
There are a few more changes to add, that's it for day two.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For day three I only added the classification of what IV lvl the pokemon are, and i added the icon, it was a huge challenge, since there are a lot of ways to do it, but none seemed to be working anymore, it was tough, but was worth it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For day four I added the IV bar using the JProgressBar, which moves by the calculated IV, it was fun.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For day five I validated the data on the text fields, creating a new class (NumberDocumentFilter), which lets only numbers between 0-15 on input(if you try to type anything other than 0-15, the text field will now receive the characters).

And Last but not least, I created a new JLabel to show "0-15" right above the text Fields, so the user knows what he needs to type.
