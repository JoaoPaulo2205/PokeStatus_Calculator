I started learning a new lib in Java, and decided to make a small project to learn and document.
For day one i made the frame about the size of the phone and created a button, using JButton.

pretty basic, there are a lot more ideas to implement, but i'll take a slow pace
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For day two, i made a lot of changes, Text Fields to insert the atribute level, and a Gengar image in the top, also, i created the funcion to calculate the IV correctly.
I used JLabel for image and text in JFrame, ImageIcon to setup the image in JLabel, JTextField to create the text field, ActionEvent to know and execute the commands whern the button is pressed.

Haven't made validantions yet, like, the IV cant be higher than 100 or less than 0.
there are a few more changes to add, thats it for day two.
